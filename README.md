Wanted to play with some data.  Unfortunately, twitter only allows 7 days for free.
Parsed tweets to create a word frequency pattern.
Did both one word and two words.  Two words led to no data.
React-easy-chart does not allow much styling, including margins.  Would pick something else for chart.

Libraries/Tools:
Create React App,
React
Redux
Express,
react-redux,
axios,
lodash
react-fa
react-easy-chart
