Offered to help a friend with a bike store build a new site.

Current site is WoodsideBikeShop.com.  How can I go wrong?

The owner does not want a store, barely wants to be contacted (I convinced him to add a call button), etc so there is very little data involved.  I did add a wordpress site and plan to add a query feature when there is some blog volume.  I set up the site so online purchases can be added later.

I wanted to learn something from doing this site since it is so simple.  I decided to up my design skills so added grid, flexbox, and animation on scroll.  It's sooooo over animated.  I'll make sure it's mobile forward this week.

I played with several npm styling packages and used some components from BlueprintJS. Hoping for a real complete component package in 2018.  No one is quite there yet.

Stack:
Node, Mongo (set up but not used yet), React, Redux

Libraries/Tools:
Create React App,
Express,
Passport,
Wordpress,
react-router-dom,
react-dom,
react-redux,
redux-thunk,
axios,
react-animate-on-scroll,
@blueprintjs/core,
react-fa
